# F1 Motion Simulator Configuration
# ==================================

telemetry:
  port: 20777           # F1 game default UDP port
  buffer_size: 2048     # UDP receive buffer size

# Motion Algorithm Parameters
# ---------------------------
# ⚠️ WARNING: These are PLACEHOLDER values!
# They MUST be tuned through physical testing in INF-111.
# Start with SMALL values and increase gradually to avoid violent motion!
motion:
  # Translation scales (G-force → meters)
  # INF-111: Tune these based on platform feel
  surge_scale: 0.05     # Longitudinal G → X translation (braking/accel)
  sway_scale: 0.05      # Lateral G → Y translation (cornering)
  heave_scale: 0.03     # Vertical G → Z translation (bumps)
  
  # Rotation scales (G-force → radians)
  # INF-111: Tune these based on platform feel
  roll_scale: 0.3       # Lateral G → Roll rotation (lean into corners)
  pitch_scale: 0.3      # Longitudinal G → Pitch rotation (brake dive)
  yaw_scale: 0.1        # Yaw passthrough scale (usually minimal)
  
  # Safety limits
  # INF-111: Adjust based on platform capabilities
  max_translation: 0.1  # Max X/Y movement in meters
  max_rotation: 0.26    # Max rotation in radians (~15 degrees)
  
  # Smoothing (exponential moving average)
  # INF-111: Higher = smoother but more lag, lower = responsive but jerky
  smoothing_factor: 0.3 # 0.0 = no smoothing, 1.0 = maximum smoothing
  
  # MOOG home position
  home_z: -0.18         # Z position at rest (meters)

# Hardware Configuration

hardware:

    baudrate: 38400       # Fixed by SMC protocol
    parity: "E"           # Even parity
    controller_id: 1      # Modbus slave ID
    stroke_mm: 100.0      # Actuator stroke length
    
  moog:
    # ⚠️ PLACEHOLDER VALUES - Must be discovered in INF-106!
    ip: "192.168.1.100"   # MOOG platform IP address
    port: 6000            # MOOG UDP port
    send_rate_hz: 60.0    # Command send rate (match F1 telemetry)

# INF-111: Parameter Tuning Guide
# ===============================
# 1. Start with all scale values at 0.01 (very small motion)
# 2. Increase surge_scale first - test with braking
# 3. Increase sway_scale - test with cornering
# 4. Increase pitch_scale - enhances braking feel
# 5. Increase roll_scale - enhances cornering feel
# 6. Adjust smoothing_factor for comfort vs responsiveness
# 7. Document final values for each user preference profile
